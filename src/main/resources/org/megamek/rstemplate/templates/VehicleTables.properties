hitLocNotes.1=* A result of 2 or 12 (or an 8 if the attack strikes the side) may infict a critical hit on the vehicle. For each result of 2 or\n\
  12 (or 8 for side attacks), apply damage normally to the armor in that section. The attacking player then automatically rolls\n\
  once on the Ground Combat Vehicle Critical Hits Table below (see Combat, p. 192, in {Total Warfare } for more information).
hitLocNotes.2=A result of 12 on the Ground Combat Vehicles Hit Location Table may infict critical hit against the turret; if the vehicle has\n\
  no turret, a 12 indicates the chance of a critical hit on the side corresponding to the attack direction.
hitLocNotes.3=\u2020 The vehicle may suffer motive system damage even if its armor remains intact. Apply damage normally to the armor in\n\
  that section, but the attacking player also rolls once on the Motive System Damage Table at right (see Combat, p. 192, in\n\
  {Total Warfare } for more information).
hitLocNotes.4=\u00A7 Side hits strike the side as indicated by the attack direction. For example, if an attack hits the right side, all Side results\n\
  strike the right side armor. If the vehicle has no turret, a turret hit strikes the armor on the side attacked.

motiveSystemNote=*All movement and Driving Skill Roll penalties are cumulative. However, each Driving Skill Roll\n\
  modifer can only be applied once. For example, if a roll of 6-7 is made for a vehicle, inficting\n\
  a +1 modifer, that is the only time that particular +1 can be applied; a subsequent roll of 6-7\n\
  has no additional effect. This means the maximum Driving Skill Roll modifer that can be\n\
  inficted from the Motive System Damage Table is +6. If a unit\u2019s Cruising MP is reduced\n\
  to 0, it cannot move for the rest of the game, but is not considered an immobile target. In\n\
  addition, all motive system damage takes effect at the end of the phase in which the damage\n\
  occurred. For example, if two units are attacking the same Combat Vehicle during the\n\
  Weapon Attack Phase and the frst unit inficts motive system damage and rolls a 12, the -4\n\
  immobile target modifer would not apply for the second unit. However, the -4 modifer would\n\
  take effect during the Physical Attack Phase. If a hover vehicle is rendered immobile while\n\
  over a Depth 1 or deeper water hex, it sinks and is destroyed.
