motiveSystemNote=*All movement and Driving Skill Roll penalties are cumulative. However, each Driving Skill Roll\n\
  modifer can only be applied once. For example, if a roll of 6-7 is made for a vehicle, inficting\n\
  a +1 modifer, that is the only time that particular +1 can be applied; a subsequent roll of 6-7\n\
  has no additional effect. This means the maximum Driving Skill Roll modifer that can be\n\
  inficted from the Motive System Damage Table is +6. If a unit\u2019s Cruising MP is reduced\n\
  to 0, it cannot move for the rest of the game, but is not considered an immobile target. In\n\
  addition, all motive system damage takes effect at the end of the phase in which the damage\n\
  occurred. For example, if two units are attacking the same Combat Vehicle during the\n\
  Weapon Attack Phase and the frst unit inficts motive system damage and rolls a 12, the -4\n\
  immobile target modifer would not apply for the second unit. However, the -4 modifer would\n\
  take effect during the Physical Attack Phase. If a hover vehicle is rendered immobile while\n\
  over a Depth 1 or deeper water hex, it sinks and is destroyed.
